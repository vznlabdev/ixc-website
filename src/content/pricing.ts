      question: "Do contractors pay to use IncoXchange?",
      answer: "Never. Contractors always use IncoXchange free. Only property management companies pay for accounts. This ensures 100% contractor adoptionâ€”they have zero reason not to join."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when I hit my property limit on the free plan?",
      answer: "You'll get a friendly notification when you reach 5 properties. You can upgrade to Professional instantly, or remove properties to stay on the free plan. Your work order history is never deleted."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change plans anytime?",
      answer: "Yes. Upgrade or downgrade whenever you want. When you upgrade, you're prorated for the current month. No contracts, no penalties, cancel anytime. We even have a \"pause\" option for seasonal businesses."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a setup fee or per-user pricing?",
      answer: "No setup fees, ever. The price you see is the price you pay. Add unlimited team members on Professional and Enterprise plans. No surprises, no \"implementation costs,\" no per seat charges. Just simple, transparent pricing."
